Based on the timing results I saw a clear pattern in the scaling of each function depending on the size of the array. As the size of the array increases, both `doublerAppend()` and `doublerInsert()` take longer to execute, which was expected. The `doublerAppend()` function performs better because its execution time increases at a relatively slower rate compared to `doublerInsert()`. Therefore, based on the observed timing results and the scalability analysis, `doublerAppend()` scales better and exhibits a more efficient runtime behavior as the array size increases.
